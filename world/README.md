# About the Game

It's going to be turn-based global strategy that runs in browser in the future. There is no server part at all for now. There is intension to proceed supporting "offline" mode in the future. Probably will be packed via [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

Basic idea and game mechanics borrowed from civilization game series but there is no intention to create exact clone of any version of civilization. It's going to something inspired or influenced by civilization.

[Try latest version](v0.2.0)

## Current Development State

Game is in early development state. There is only "sandbox" mode for testing and demonstrating basic game mechanics. The main focus for now is implementing and polishing game core engine and mechanics. So UI/UX and graphics might be awful for now. Map view are top-down with schemantic objects representations.

## Sandbox Mode

In this mode allowed to do things which should be restricted by rules in game mode. For example, place game object on any tile in any moment. However, all game mechanics should works in the same way as in game mode.
