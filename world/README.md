# About the Game

It's going to be turn-based global strategy that runs in browser. There is no server part at all for now and "offline" mode will be continued supported in the future.

Basic idea and game mechanics borrowed from civilization game series but there is no intention to create exact clone of any version of civilization. It's going to something inspired or influenced by civilization.

## Current Development State

Game is in early development state. The main focus for now is implementing and polishing game core engine and mechanics. So UI/UX and graphics might be awful for now. Map view are top-down with schemantic objects representations.

There is only "sandbox" mode for testing and demonstrating basic game mechanics. In this mode allowed to do things which will be restricted by rules in game mode. For example, place game object on any tile in any moment.
